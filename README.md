## Student Management System

This is a desktop application for managing students data,  
in universities and colleges.  
You can add, edit and delete students from the application.   
The app window and table are adjustable.  
For the GUI I used PyQt6 and for the database I've used MySQL.  
The primary key id is auto increment (database configuration).  
The status bar appears only if you select a table cell,  
and then you can edit or delete the student data.  
This is an OOP project.
